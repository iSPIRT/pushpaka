<h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>The Unmanned Aircraft (UA) industry has impacted the aviation industry by introducing
technological advancements at an unprecedented pace over the last 10 years. New
Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) is being demonstrated across the world daily with
enhanced technical capabilities to push the boundaries of the unmanned aviation industry.
These technological advancements have enabled UAS to conduct various complex
operations including but not limited to surveillance, surveying, spraying, mapping,
inspections and deliveries, especially in the low-level airspaces. Such use cases have
empowered stakeholders and businesses across different industries like Agriculture,
Construction, Disaster Management, Energy, GIS, Healthcare, Insurance, Security, Mining,
Oil and Gas, Telecom, etc. to improve their efficiency and deliver enhanced services. It is
natural that progressively the density of UA in the airspace is going to increase. Further, as
various UAS use cases evolve and the world starts looking at advanced use cases such as
Unmanned Aerial Mobility, it is clear that Unmanned Aircraft (UA) will need to start flying
alongside Manned Aircraft (MA). Maintaining acceptable levels of aviation safety in such
scenarios would be the primary consideration for active integration of manned and
unmanned aircraft in the National Airspace.</p>
<h3 id="need-for-utm">Need for UTM</h3>
<p>Integration of UAS into the National Airspace System (NAS) presents various challenges
technically and operationally. Integrating UAS operations within the current Air Traffic
Management (ATM) Systems may bring in the need to equip UAs with additional hardware
on-board and even qualify them to the much higher manned aviation standards, which is
neither advisable nor feasible for all kinds of UAS. Further, ATM Systems may not be
equipped to handle millions of UAS flights as the density of UA in the airspace increases
with different UAS proving their effectiveness in various consumer, commercial and security
scenarios. This scenario motivates the need for creating a separate system for the control of
Unmanned Traffic and its subsequent integration with the ATM Systems, which would be
complementary to the existing ATM systems
UAS Traffic Management (UTM) ecosystem is hence envisioned to be an essential
requirement to augment the present ATM Systems and will play a major role by providing
various services to Remote Pilots and managing traffic of UAs across the designated UTM
(in some cases ATM) airspaces while acting as an interface between the UAS, Remote
Pilots, Regulatory Systems, ATM systems and other required systems from time to time.
Since the UTM systems are primarily software-based and automate most of the UAS traffic
management functions, they would enable large volumes of UA Operations while bringing in
the following key benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>seamless integration with the Regulatory Systems;</li>
<li>the continued safety of all air traffic, both manned and unmanned within the UTM designated airspace;</li>
<li>real-time situational awareness of the low-level airspace to all stakeholders;</li>
<li>safety &amp; privacy of persons on the ground;</li>
<li>support complex low-level UA operations;</li>
<li>ongoing support of technological advancements;</li>
<li>evaluation of security and environmental risks; and</li>
<li>provision for a global, harmonized framework for low-level UTM.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="scope">Scope</h3>
<p>This policy document focuses on UAS Operations typically below 1000 feet above ground
level (AGL) and addresses increasingly complex UAS operations primarily within
uncontrolled (Class G) airspace (defined below) and while moving between designated
controlled (Class B, C, D and E) airspace and uncontrolled airspace environments. It also
introduces UA Operational scenarios that include Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS)
operations in different classes of airspaces.
Class G airspace is the portion of the National Airspace System that has not been
designated as controlled airspace (i.e. Class B, C, D, or E). It is, therefore, designated as
uncontrolled airspace. ATC has no responsibility towards providing separation services in
Class G airspace; rather, Manned Aircraft cooperatively manage their operations
predominantly through visual means based on specified principles and rules of operation
and also through the traffic information service and alerting service provided by ATM. In
order to provide UAS with the same level of airspace access as Manned Aircraft, UTM
Ecosystem is designed to provide a similar means of cooperative traffic management for
UAS and other participating manned aircraft in uncontrolled airspace.</p>

<p>The primary objective of this policy document is to define how various UA Operational
Scenarios will be enabled in the low-level airspace using the UTM Ecosystem and the
Regulatory System referred to as the DigitalSky Platform. This document captures the
interaction of various stakeholders with the DigitalSky Platform. This document will also
further identify a vision and a roadmap for enabling future UA operational scenarios in all
airspaces while addressing aviation security concerns and measures to mitigate them based
on threat and risk assessments. Various concepts like the UTM Stakeholders, UTM
Architecture, UTM Services, UTM-ATM Integration, Data Security and Data Privacy, which
are key to the operationalisation of the UTM Ecosystem in India, are further identified in this
document.
This document identifies key stakeholders responsible for interacting with the UTM
Ecosystem for enabling seamless UA Operations across India. The primary responsibilities
of these key stakeholders, both government and private stakeholders are also identified.
Further, the architecture and the flow of data exchange between various stakeholders and
service providers of the UTM Ecosystem which include but are not limited to UAS, Remote
Pilots, UTM systems, DigitalSky Platform, Data Provider Platforms, ANSPs, Government
Stakeholders is also identified. This document also identifies the need for various
interoperability standards between key stakeholders of the UTM Ecosystem.
This document broadly defines the integration of the UTM Ecosystem with existing ATM
systems through the DigitalSky Platform to enable more Operational Scenarios and further
enhance the safety of Manned and Unmanned Aviation in India.
The document also identifies a few standard UA Operational Scenarios and provides a brief
explanation of how the UA Operational Scenario will be enabled within the UTM Ecosystem.
Lastly, the underlying objective of this document is to enable more and more UA Operational
Scenarios, increase the ease of compliance for the Unmanned Aviation Industry while
ensuring the highest levels of safety and security.</p>
<h2 id="utm-operational-concept">UTM OPERATIONAL CONCEPT</h2>
<p>UAS Traffic Management (UTM) Ecosystem is envisioned as a cooperatively driven and
collaborative extension of the current Air Traffic Management (ATM) Services; for
Unmanned Systems; in airspaces where such ATM services currently either do not exist or
are not adequate to handle the expected volumes of UA traffic and level of services such
aircraft demand. The UTM Ecosystem utilizes the industry’s capabilities to create, deploy
and provide such services by developing software platforms under the standards published
by the Regulators and will be enabled using the concept of UTM Service Providers
(UTMSPs).
The UTM Ecosystem in India includes a set of distributed services and an all-encompassing
DigitalSky Platform and is built on a layered approach of information sharing and data
exchange standards between Remote Pilot to Remote Pilot, UAS to UAS and Remote Pilot
to DigitalSky Platform via UTMSPs. Such defined services are separate but are, to a fair
extent, similar to ATM Services provided by the Air Traffic Services Units and are primarily
based on sharing flight intent and situational awareness. These services are a key aspect of
providing safe and secure UA Operations, as they support flight planning, receiving flight
authorisation, real-time situational awareness, communication services, weather services,
deconfliction services, amongst others.</p>
<p>Figure 3.1: Layered Approach of the Indian UTM Ecosystem</p>
<p>Remote Pilots may choose to consume such services from any UTMSP. UTMSPs integrate
with the DigitalSky Platform to provide DigitalSky services and additional services to the
Remote Pilots for enhancing the safety, ease of conducting UA Operations. A UTMSP will
work as one of the primary interfaces for the exchange of information with the Remote Pilot
while keeping DigitalSky Platform as the primary authority for flight approvals. Multiple
UTMSPs and the DigitalSky Platform will work together through a coordinated effort using
published Data Exchange Standards to promote safe UA Operations.</p>
<p>Remote Pilots can share their flight intent with each other through such coordinated effort of
multiple UTMSPs to deconflict flight paths and maintain safe separation between flight paths.
The UTMSPs will provide an easy to use interface for the Remote Pilots to submit
information, communicate and coordinate with other Remote PIlots, Regulatory Bodies, Air
Traffic Management Providers and other stakeholders using an automated and layered
network of information exchange via various UTMSPs rather than direct voice
communication. The UTM Ecosystem will provide different stakeholders with real-time
situational awareness on a need to know basis to safely manage UAS operations in Indian
airspace.</p>
<h2 id="utm-stakeholders">UTM STAKEHOLDERS</h2>
<h3 id="identification-of-stakeholders">Identification of Stakeholders</h3>
<p>The UTM Ecosystem is envisioned as an active collaboration between multiple stakeholders
connected to each other through information sharing and data exchange standards.</p>
<h4 id="airports-authority-of-india-aai">Airports Authority of India (AAI)</h4>
<p>Airports Authority of India (AAI) is the nodal authority responsible for the development,
maintenance and technical operation of the DigitalSky Platform on behalf of DGCA. Its
primary responsibility involves coordinating with different stakeholders for managing
operations in conformance with various standards published or adopted by the DGCA. AAI
achieves this by maintaining an operational environment of the National Airspace in the
country. This operational environment consists of the National Airspace Map (Green, Yellow,
Red Zones), flight intents of aircraft (manned and unmanned) and historic information of all
flights (manned and unmanned). The National Airspace Map is maintained with active inputs
from various Airspace Owners. Information about this operational environment is made
available to relevant stakeholders on a need to know basis. AAI is also responsible for
approving UAS flight plans in airspaces under its jurisdiction.
The DigitalSky Platform connects with government agencies, security agencies,
supplementary data providers (weather, terrain, etc.) and other relevant stakeholders for
providing different services through the DigitalSky Platform. The DigitalSky Platform and the
UTM Ecosystem assists different stakeholders by providing operational services like flight
planning, flight approval, strategic and dynamic deconfliction (if required), real-time flight
monitoring, etc. The Remote Pilot can connect with the DigitalSky Platform and avail such
services through one of the UTMSPs.</p>
<h4 id="air-defence-authority-iaf">Air Defence Authority (IAF)</h4>
<p>Air Defence Units of Indian Air Force are responsible for monitoring all manned and
unmanned air operations in the national airspace. Their primary objective is to ensure all
aircraft operations in the country are identified and correlated with the known details
submitted as flight plans.</p>
<h4 id="military-authorities-iaf-army-navy-coast-guard-hal">Military Authorities (IAF, Army, Navy, Coast Guard, HAL)</h4>
<p>Military authorities normally conduct their operations within segregated military airspaces.
For segregation of such airspaces, the military authorities will be creating permanent or
temporary flight restrictions through the DigitalSky Platform. They will also be responsible to
allow exemptions for such UA operations which may be required to be conducted within their
airspaces.</p>
<h4 id="bcas">BCAS</h4>
<p>The BCAS is the regulatory authority for Civil Aviation Security in India. BCAS is responsible
for laying down Aviation Security Standards for implementing AVSEC measures and
monitoring the implementation of these security rules and regulations. The BCAS achieves
this by notifying the Security Program for RPAS and providing AVSEC training to various
stakeholders of the UAS ecosystem.</p>
<h4 id="dgca">DGCA</h4>
<p>The DGCA is the regulatory authority responsible for setting up various standards and
operating procedures related to manned and unmanned aviation in India and owns the
DigitalSky Platform being developed by AAI under the aegis of the Ministry of Civil Aviation,
Government of India. The DGCA achieves this by defining airworthiness requirements,
equipment requirements and operational requirements for UAS in India. These requirements
are different depending upon the weight category of the UAS, the intended use cases and
the intended area of operations. DGCA is also responsible for setting up the certification
standards for validating conformance to such airworthiness and equipment requirements and
provides the Certificate of Compliance to such UAS that are compliant under the scheme.
The DGCA is responsible for approving the registration of UAS, other stakeholders of the
UAS Ecosystem and processing of special exemption requests through the DigitalSky
Platform.</p>
<h4 id="remote-pilot">Remote Pilot</h4>
<p>The remote pilot is the primary person responsible for the safe conduct of each UA flight.
The remote pilot uses one of the UTMSPs for exchange of necessary information with the
DigitalSky Platform. The remote pilot adheres to all the operational requirements of the
airspace in which the UA is flying including conformance to the approved flight path, avoiding
obstacles like terrain and buildings, avoiding flights during inappropriate weather and always
giving way to manned aircraft. The remote pilot constantly monitors the flight performance
and the location of the UA either directly or assisted by another person (Remote Observer)
or a UTM Service Provider. In case the safety of the flight is compromised and the remote
pilot notices any issues or defects during the conduct of the flight, the remote pilot intervenes
immediately. The remote pilot also informs the DGCA via the UTMSP in case of any such
incident.</p>
<h4 id="law-enforcement-and-security-agencies">Law Enforcement and Security Agencies</h4>
<p>Law Enforcement and Security Agencies may require access to real-time or historic
information from the DigitalSky Platform for various Security, Surveillance and Counter UAS
(CUAS) purposes. Such access to information may be provided to relevant authorities as
needed to protect the safety of airspace, persons or critical infrastructures like airports and
other strategic installations. Such agencies may also set up various Counter UAS systems to
protect sensitive areas by detecting UAS operating in such areas. These Counter-UAS
systems can be interfaced with the UTM Ecosystem for identifying whether a UAS detected
by the Counter UAS system is friend or foe.</p>
<h4 id="general-public">General Public</h4>
<p>The UTM Ecosystem will make data about active UA operations available to the general
public via UTMSP on a need to know basis. The general public may use UTMSPs to access
such data and report issues in case if they may notice a particular UAS is not flying as per
recommended norms or in case a UAS is breaching their privacy.</p>
<h3 id="roles-and-responsibilities">Roles and Responsibilities</h3>
<p>Stakeholders may perform various roles in the UTM Ecosystem. In one scenario they may
be creating new information for the UTM Ecosystem whereas in another scenario they may
be consuming information generated by other stakeholders. Also, a single stakeholder may
perform both types of functions in different scenarios. For understanding the roles and
responsibilities of individual stakeholders in-depth, each stakeholder’s actions are further
classified by the role that they play while fulfilling or consuming various UTM services. This
is classified as Service Seeker, Service Provider or Service Enabler</p>
<h4 id="service-seeker">Service Seeker</h4>
<p>A stakeholder is identified as a Service Seeker, when a particular stakeholder is seeking
authorisation and/or information from another stakeholder of the UTM Ecosystem or from the
DigitalSky Platform itself either directly or through a UTMSP, for performing any function
related to UAS Operations. Eg. Remote Pilots are identified as a ‘Service Seeker’ when they
seek authorization for flight operations.</p>
<h4 id="service-provider">Service Provider</h4>
<p>A stakeholder is identified as a Service Provider when a particular stakeholder provides
authorisation and/or information to another stakeholder of the UTM Ecosystem for
performing any function related to UAS Operations. Eg. DGCA is identified as a ‘Service
Provider’ when it is providing authorisation for registering UAS on the DigitalSky Platform.</p>
<h4 id="service-enabler">Service Enabler</h4>
<p>A stakeholder is identified as a Service Enabler when a particular stakeholder is assisting
another stakeholder for providing authorisation and/or information to a stakeholder of the
UTM Ecosystem for performing any function related to UAS Operations. Eg. The Ministry of
Environment, Forest and Climate Change is identified as a ‘Service Enabler’ by providing
additional airspace constraints near ecologically sensitive areas.
Please refer to Appendix 1 for a complete list of roles and responsibilities of stakeholders.</p>
<h3 id="relationship-matrix">Relationship Matrix</h3>
<p>Appendix 2 defines the relationship between two stakeholders for each service and further
clarifies the accountability of each stakeholder. The relationship matrix identifies the Service
Seeker, Service Provider and Service Enabler (if any) for each UTM Service.</p>
<h3 id="role-of-government-and-private-entities-in-utm-service">Role of Government and Private Entities in UTM Service</h3>
<p>The role of government and various government organizations in the UTM Ecosystem is
more of regulatory intervention and oversight rather than a full-fledged partnership.
Government stakeholders act as an enabler to support the UAS Operations in India. The
Indian airspace will be opened up for competent and qualified individuals or organizations to
provide UTM services by registering themselves as UTM Service Providers as per the UTM
Deployment Plan stated in the subsequent chapter of this document. Such stakeholders may
be publicly owned, privately owned or be based on a Public-Private Partnership Model. For
any of the models, the regulatory control will still be with the Government, with adequate
powers vested on various regulators under the central government.
However, to ensure the UTM services on PAN-India basis, DigitalSky Platform would also
act as a UTM Service Provider for whole India airspace. DigitalSky would operate as a
PAN-India UTMSP and would provide all the necessary services for UA Operations.
Additionally, the DigitalSky platform would always be responsible for providing airspace
mapping, approval, authorisation and other related services to various regulators and
government authorities. It would also act as the single hub of all registry, flight information,
constraint management, flight data management and discovery &amp; synchronization services.</p>
<h2 id="utm-architecture">UTM ARCHITECTURE</h2>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>With the UTM Ecosystem in India, the DGCA and AAI continue to maintain their regulatory
and operational authority for certifying UAS and managing low-level airspace and traffic
operations; however such operations are not managed by the DGCA or the ATC manually.
Rather they are organised, coordinated and managed by a distributed set of actors in a
highly automated software-based ecosystem. Figure 5.1 represents the proposed UTM
Architecture of India. The figure highlights various blocks (components of the UTM
Ecosystem represented by a blue dashed box) of the proposed UTM Architecture and
different stakeholders inside each block. The solid black lines connect various blocks with
each other to highlight their interdependence and show the information flow between
different blocks and stakeholders. This figure represents the proposed architecture of the
Indian UTM Ecosystem, which may be updated in subsequent versions of this document.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="ecosystem.svg" alt="UTM Ecosystem">
    <figcaption>Figure 5.1: UTM Ecosystem<figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The UTM Architecture creates an interface to the DigitalSky Platform via various UTM
Service Providers and is primarily divided into the following components: DigitalSky Platform,
UTM Service Providers, UAS Supplementary Service Providers, UAS and Remote Pilots,
Government Stakeholders and General Public. Each component provides specific user
interfaces and APIs for stakeholders to interact with the UTM Ecosystem and perform their
primary functions while ensuring the safety and security aspects related to UAS Operations
in India.</p>
<h3 id="utm-architecture-components">UTM Architecture Components</h3>
<h4 id="digitalsky-platform">DigitalSky Platform</h4>
<p>The DigitalSky Platform is central to India’s UAS Ecosystem. It creates an automated,
seamless and centralized regulatory environment for stakeholders to collaborate in real-time.
DigitalSky Platform would also be providing the UTM services for the PAN-India airspace.
One of the primary functions of the DigitalSky Platform is to act as a seamless and
automated communication channel between the UAS industry, regulators and other
government stakeholders to perform various functions related to UAS Operations. The
DGCA can issue registrations and permits like Registration of a UAS, issuance of a Remote
Pilot License, Issuance of Operator Permit, etc automatically through the DigitalSky
Platform. Airspace owners can use the DigitalSky Platform to define or modify airspace
constraints such as creating temporary or permanent flight restrictions or cancelling any
planned/approved operation in case of any emergency. Supplementary data such as
weather, terrain, real-time flight paths of manned aircraft can be integrated into the
DigitalSky Platform to enhance safety while approving UAS Operations. The DigitalSky
Platform further becomes the central data archive for all flight permissions and flight logs.
Security agencies and other relevant stakeholders can interface with the DigitalSky Platform
to have complete, real-time, situational awareness for all UAS operations in India.</p>
<p>Figure 5.2: DigitalSky Platform</p>
<p>As explained in Figure 5.1 and further enhanced in Figure 5.2, the DigitalSky Platform is
divided into 3 components: DigitalSky Engine, DigitalSky Government User Interface and
DigitalSky UTMSP. The DigitalSky Engine is the primary engine which is responsible for
managing different databases, implementation of business rules and integration with various
third party services and platforms. This engine is the core of India’s UAS Ecosystem. The
DigitalSky Engine also interfaces with the various UTMSPs via APIs to assist the UTMSPs in
augmenting the functionality of the DigitalSky Platform. The DigitalSky Government User
Interface is that component of the DigitalSky which provides various regulators and
administrators like Airspace Owners, DGCA, central and state government departments,
Security Agencies an interface to perform various functions under their purview. The
DigitalSky Government is a component of the DigitalSky Platform which is built on the
DigitalSky Engine to cater to the needs of the regulators and administrators like Airspace
Owners, DGCA, central and state government departments, Security Agencies. The last
component of the DigitalSky Platform is the DigitalSky UTMSP. As discussed earlier, the
DigitalSky Platform will continue to remain a Pan-India UTMSP while providing all the list of
services required for conducting safe UA Operations. With such a scenario, government
stakeholders would be able to interact with the UTM Ecosystem of India via the DigitalSky
UTMSP. This DigitalSky UTMSP will also be directly accessible via the DigitalSky
Government User Interface. However, the DigitalSky UTMSP would also be available to
non-government stakeholders for the various services for enabling the UA Operations. The
DigitalSky UTMSP and other UTMSPs are envisaged to provide similar services for enabling
UA operations.</p>
<h4 id="no-permission-no-takeoff-npnt-permission-artefacts">No Permission No Takeoff (NPNT) &amp; Permission Artefacts</h4>
<p>Digital Sky enables a proactive approach to enforcement of safety and security guidelines by
ensuring that a UAS does not take-off without a signed (and encrypted) digital permission
known as the Permission Artefact (PA). This Permission Artefact is issued for each UAS
Operation and includes 4 dimensional (x,y,z,t) authorization information about each
operation. This is essentially called the No-Permission No Takeoff (NPNT) model. The
NPNT model is at the core of the Indian UTM Ecosystem and provides an additional layer of
safety and security by defining the area of UA operation within the Permission Artefact. Also,
the mandatory implementation of risk mitigation features like Return to Home in case of a
breach of the area of operation as specified in the permission, makes sure that the
DigitalSky Platform has complete knowledge about the possible position of all UAS even
without tracking their real-time telemetry. Certainly, tracking real-time telemetry of the UA will
be required for advanced use cases where the density of UA is more or if the area of UA
operation is sensitive.
Remote Pilots will be seeking flight approvals from the DigitalSky Platform through a
UTMSP. The UTMSPs may provide Remote Pilots with pre-flight functionalities like Weather
data, Terrain data, Strategic Deconfliction with other approved UAS flights etc. However, the
responsibility of approving the UAS flight plan and issuing the Permission Artefact would
always remain with the DigitalSky Platform. Additional data fields may be added in the
Permission Artefact to identify the UTMSP used for seeking the flight permission. Further,
the standard defining the Permission Artefact may be modified from time to time as per the
requirements of the UTM Ecosystem.</p>
<h4 id="utm-service-providers-utmsp">UTM Service Providers (UTMSP)</h4>
<p>The UTM Service Provider (UTMSP) is an integral part of the UTM Ecosystem. It acts as the
primary interface between the industry stakeholders of the UAS Ecosystem and the
Regulators. A UTMSP is expected to develop technical and operational capabilities for
augmenting the functionalities of the DigitalSky Platform. UTMSPs will host the technical
infrastructure and provide services to manufacturers, importers, traders, operators and
remote pilots. The primary responsibility of the UTMSP would be to provide UTM services to
Remote Pilots and share essential information across the UTM Ecosystem to relevant
stakeholders for maintaining safety and situational awareness across the UTM Airspace.
A UTMSP acts as a real-time or near real-time communication bridge between other
UTMSPs, Remote Pilots, DGCA, AAI, DigitalSky Platform and other relevant stakeholders
from time to time. It helps remote pilots seek authorisation and communicate safety-critical
information to relevant stakeholders automatically and efficiently. The UTMSP acts as the
single point which aggregates different types of information such as flight intents, real-time
telemetry, weather data, etc and communicates it with relevant stakeholders as required.
UTMSPs shall share all the information with the DigitalSky Platform whenever requested.
It helps the remote pilots meet various UTM requirements that may be necessary for
compliance during their participation in the UTM airspace. In addition to the basic regulatory
functionalities, the UTMSP may create certain industry-specific niche functionalities that may
be valuable additions to the UAS industry. The UTMSP provides such functionalities to the
Remote Pilots through UTM services. Such services support registration, flight planning,
dynamic deconfliction, conformance monitoring and other safety-related services.
All UTMSPs share data with each other for complete airspace transparency and enhancing
the safety of UAS Operations. For eg. UTMSP A will share flight intent and real-time flight
information of all UAS to UTMSP B in case UTMSP B also has flights intents or active flights
in the same airspace, via Inter-UTM Communication. Another such example could be the
DigitalSky Platform notifying all UTMSPs about new temporary airspace restrictions that may
be created on-demand. Such information exchange will happen between trusted parties over
secure protocols over the internet and will use a Discovery and Synchronisation Service
hosted by the DigitalSky Platform. This will ensure coordinated and cooperative airspace
management by different UTMSPs. Such Inter-UTM Communication may be offered as a
third-party service offered by one or more selected, qualified service providers.
Further, each UTMSP may also employ suitably qualified and authorised UTM Personnel
with an appropriate background in Aviation and/or Information Technology to supervise and
manage the UTM Operations. Such personnel are not envisaged to get involved in the
general operations of the UTM system but may take actions to manage special and/or
emergency situations.
As shown in Figure 5.1, the UTMSP sits at the centre of the UTM Ecosystem and connects
with all other blocks of the UTM architecture.</p>
<h5 id="uas-supplementary-data-service-providers">UAS Supplementary Data Service Providers</h5>
<p>Remote pilots may connect with Supplementary Data Service Providers (SDSP)
independently or preferably via the UTMSP to consume data such as navigation data,
airspace surveillance data, weather data, terrain and obstacle data to further enhance the
safety of their flight operations. Remote Pilots may consume such data only from service
providers who conform to minimum accuracy standards as laid out by the Regulator and will
be authorized by the respective regulatory authorities. Such data will be exchanged between
trusted parties over secure communication protocols over the internet. Regulators may
mandate minimum accuracy or other standards for certain supplementary data from time to
time.</p>
<h4 id="uas-and-remote-pilots">UAS and Remote Pilots</h4>
<p>All remote pilots are required to participate in the UTM Ecosystem while they are in the
designated UTM Airspace. The level of participation, number and type of services required
may vary depending upon the operational scenario and the location of the flight. Eg. Remote
pilots may not continuously speak to the ATC for all types of flights.</p>
<h4 id="government-stakeholders">Government Stakeholders</h4>
<p>Government stakeholders in the UTM ecosystem include the safety regulator (DGCA), the
security regulator (BCAS), the civil ANSP (AAI), the military ANSPs (IAF, Navy, HAL), Air
Defence authority (IAF-AD), airspace owners (Ministries, Organisations, Authorities, State
Governments, etc).
Government stakeholders form the core group for UA flight management processes. Each
government stakeholder has some role to ensure that UA operations are safe and secure to
all involved and uninvolved stakeholders. They create the business rules, manage the
constraints in the form of permanent and temporary flight restrictions and ensure
conformance to the rules and regulations.
Government stakeholders access the UTM system through DigitalSky Government User
Interface.</p>
<h4 id="general-public-uninvolved-persons">General Public (Uninvolved Persons)</h4>
<p>The UTM Ecosystem will make data about active UA operations available to the general
public via UTMSP on a need to know basis. The general public may use UTMSPs to access
such data and report issues in case if they may notice a particular UAS is not flying as per
recommended norms or in case a UAS is breaching their privacy. This data can be made
available to the General Public, over a secure internet connection, by implementing
Identification and location tracking standards for UAS.</p>
<h3 id="utm-participation">UTM Participation</h3>
<p>Manned and Unmanned Aircraft Pilots are required to participate in the UTM Ecosystem
depending upon the nature of the flight operations. Participation in the UTM Ecosystem may
be active or passive, depending upon the UA type and Flight Operation. Active participation
is required for operational scenarios which involve higher risks. This document further
identifies high-risk operational scenarios where active participation may be mandatory and
low-risk operational scenarios where such participation may be voluntary.</p>
<h4 id="active-and-passive-participation">Active and Passive Participation</h4>
<p>Active Participation: Manned and Unmanned Aircraft Pilots make their flight intent available
to all other pilots participating in the UTM airspace. Furthermore, pilots also share real-time
telemetry available to all other pilots participating in the UTM airspace via UTMSPs. Such
participation ensures that flights with active participation can be tracked in real-time,
fostering complete situational awareness for all participants.
Passive participation: During passive participation, pilots (both manned and unmanned) are
required to share their flight intent only. Such pilots may not share their telemetry in
real-time. They can utilize information provided by the UTMSPs (flight intent and real-time
telemetry of other pilots) to gain situational awareness of nearby operations and plan their
activities.</p>
<h4 id="mandatory-and-voluntary-participation">Mandatory and Voluntary Participation</h4>
<p>Depending upon the UA type and operational scenario, participation in the UTM Ecosystem
may be mandatory or voluntary.</p>
<p>Active Participation in UTM Service in the airspace concerned shall be mandatory for:</p>
<ol>
<li>All UAS operations except for Nano UA below 50 ft. Above Ground Level (AGL) operating in uncontrolled airspace, Non-Detachable Tethered UAS and any UAS operating in enclosed premises; and</li>
<li>Unmanned Aerial Mobility operations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Passive Participation in UTM Service in the airspace concerned shall be mandatory to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Heavy Unmanned Free Balloons; and</li>
<li>Model aircraft operations above 100 ft. AGL if flown outside designated flying areas.</li>
</ol>
<p>Passive Participation in UTM Service in the airspace concerned is voluntary but
recommended for:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nano UA below 50 ft. AGL operating in uncontrolled Airspace;</li>
<li>Model aircraft operations at or below 100 ft. AGL flying outside published model aircraft flying areas;</li>
<li>Small and Medium Unmanned Free Balloons; and</li>
<li>Other flying objects such as Gliders, Hang-gliders, Paragliders, Paramotors, Manned
(Hot Air) Balloons, Tethered Balloons, Non-Detachable Tethered UAS, Airships and
Gyroplanes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Active Participation or Passive Participation in UTM Service in the airspace concerned is
voluntary but strongly recommended for all manned aircraft operations in the concerned
UTM airspace and near ATM-UTM boundaries.</p>
<h3 id="utm-services">UTM Services</h3>
<p>UTM services support the functionalities of the UTM Ecosystem by enabling communication
and data exchange between multiple stakeholders in a modular approach. Such services
also used to connect UTMSPs with each other to support various functionalities necessary
for safe UA operations. UTM Services are grouped into various categories as follows:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="services.svg" alt="UTM Service Categories">
    <figcaption>Figure 5.3: UTM Service Categories<figcaption>
</figure>

<h4 id="digitalsky-engine-services">DigitalSky Engine Services</h4>
<p>Primary DigitalSky Engine Services are as mentioned below:</p>
<h5 id="airspace-authorisation">Airspace Authorisation</h5>
<p>All remote pilots conducting UA operations are required to obtain airspace approval
(4-dimensional permission artefact) from various airspace owners as mandated by the
competent authority. This service helps the Remote Pilot connect with the relevant Regulator
/ Airspace Owner / Air Navigation Service Provider for obtaining the specified authorisation
digitally.</p>
<h6 id="constraint-mapping">Constraint Mapping</h6>
<p>A digital map with appropriate constraints/restrictions needs to be maintained for facilitating
seamless flight authorisation to various remote pilots. This service enables mapping of
airspace constraints (e.g., airspace restrictions, special use airspace, NOTAMs, UVRs) and
ground &amp; operational constraints (e.g., public gatherings, sensitive areas, obstacles)
necessary to meet the safety and mission needs of UAS operations and support in-flight and
planning-related services.</p>
<h6 id="exemption-processing">Exemption Processing</h6>
<p>In case of special operations like flying in red zones, flying special UAS, etc. the remote pilot
may need to apply for exemptions from various provisions of the law. The exemption
processing service supports flight planning and authorisation of UAS operations for such
special or non-standard UAS operational scenarios requiring special certification and/or
authorization. Such requests for exemption would be routed to the appropriate agencies
through the DigitalSky Platform and permission artefact(s) would be generated after the
approval of the appropriate agencies.</p>
<h5 id="registration">Registration</h5>
<p>All stakeholders of the UTM Ecosystem like UAS Owners, Operators, Remote Pilots,
Manufacturers, Traders, Importers and other stakeholders need to be registered for
identification and consumption of various UTM services. Registration service provides the
ability for these stakeholders to register data related to their area of activity and query
functionality to allow appropriate stakeholders to request registration data.</p>
<h5 id="digitalsky-engine-messaging">DigitalSky Engine Messaging</h5>
<p>Stakeholders of the UTM ecosystem generate data at multiple sources and require
comprehensive communication capabilities to synchronize such information between each
other. DigitalSky Engine Messaging service provides on-demand, periodic, or event-driven
message exchange capabilities with DigitalSky Engine and other stakeholders for exchange
of information and to satisfy applicable regulatory / policy requirements.</p>
<h4 id="utm-services_1">UTM Services</h4>
<p>Primary UTM Services are as mentioned below:</p>
<h5 id="strategic-deconfliction">Strategic Deconfliction</h5>
<p>Strategic deconfliction services ensure that UA operations can be conducted in a safe
manner while maintaining safe separation. Strategic deconfliction service arranges,
negotiates, and prioritizes intended operation volumes/trajectories of UAS operations in the
pre-flight stage with the objective of minimizing the likelihood of airborne conflicts between
operations.</p>
<h5 id="dynamic-deconfliction">Dynamic Deconfliction</h5>
<p>Dynamic deconfliction service provides real-time modifications to intended operation
volumes/trajectories to minimize the likelihood of airborne conflicts and maximize the
likelihood of conforming to airspace restrictions and maintaining mission objectives. This
service arranges, negotiates, and prioritizes inflight operation volumes/trajectories of UAS
operations while the UAS is aloft.</p>
<h6 id="conformance-monitoring">Conformance Monitoring</h6>
<p>Conformance monitoring service provides the remote pilot with information to maintain
conformance with its intended area of operation, or real-time alerting of imminent or actual
non-conformance of the UA operation to the remote pilot, another airspace user or any other
relevant stakeholder.</p>
<h6 id="conflict-advisory-alert">Conflict Advisory &amp; Alert</h6>
<p>Conflict Advisory &amp; Alert service assists the remote pilot to avoid any conflict during the UAS
Operation by providing a visual and/or audible alert and suggestive and/or directive
information including, but not limited to, weather, terrain, obstacle, manned &amp; unmanned
aircraft proximity. This service also provides stakeholders with other relevant alerts as
generated by the UTM system from time to time.</p>
<h5 id="constraint-management">Constraint Management</h5>
<p>Constraint Management service supports the provision of operational constraint information
related to public safety activities, as well as applicable constraint information from the
Regulator / Airspace Authority / ANSP and other authorized sources, to UAS Operators
through UTMSPs.</p>
<h5 id="contingency-management">Contingency Management</h5>
<p>Contingency Management service provides assistance for participating in manned and
unmanned aircraft in contingency situations.</p>
<h5 id="real-time-tracking">Real-time Tracking</h5>
<p>Real-time Tracking service provides the real-time identification and tracking of UAS in-flight
in the airspace defined.</p>
<h5 id="operator-messaging">Operator Messaging</h5>
<p>Operator Messaging service provides on-demand, periodic, or event-driven message
exchange capabilities in support of UAS Operator / Remote Pilot activities. Examples of
exchanged information include position reports, intent information, and status information.</p>
<h5 id="incident-management">Incident Management</h5>
<p>Incident Management service provides remote pilots and other stakeholders the ability to file
an accident/incident with details which may occur during operations.</p>
<h5 id="utm-network-discovery">UTM Network Discovery</h5>
<p>UTM Network Discovery Service enables authorized UTM stakeholders to discover various
UTM entities, for example, relevant UTMSPs and operations within a specified geographical
area. The network operates in accordance with applicable standards. Each UTMSP’s access
to the network will be qualified against the performance requirements necessary to be
connected with the DigitalSky Engine portion of the network.</p>
<h4 id="uas-supplementary-data-service-provider-sdsp-services">UAS Supplementary Data Service Provider (SDSP) Services</h4>
<p>Primary Supplementary Data Service Provider (SDSP) Services are as mentioned below:</p>
<h5 id="navigation">Navigation</h5>
<p>Navigation services are a set of strategic and tactical services that provide historical quality
of service performance for airspace surveying during the safety development phase,
coverage maps during the flight planning phase, and real-time integrity, availability, quality of
service.</p>
<h5 id="surveillance">Surveillance</h5>
<p>Surveillance services provide a set of strategic and tactical services that support air risk
assessment for safety case development, flight planning with airspace heat maps based on
common traffic patterns, and flight operations by providing real-time tracking information of
air traffic for a given geographic area. Surveillance services consist of three primary means
of collecting information regarding airborne hazards: terrestrial surveillance, airborne
surveillance, and satellite surveillance.</p>
<h5 id="weather-data">Weather Data</h5>
<p>Weather Data services provide forecast and/or real-time weather information to support
operational decisions of remote pilots and/or UTM services.</p>
<h5 id="terrain-data">Terrain Data</h5>
<p>Terrain Data services provide terrain information to support operational decisions of
individual operators and/or UTM services.</p>
<h5 id="other-data-providers">Other Data Providers</h5>
<p>Other data service providers providing population data, telecom network coverage data may
also be involved in the UTM Ecosystem and may be listed and further identified in the
subsequent versions of this document.</p>
<h4 id="uas-services">UAS Services</h4>
<p>Primary UAS Services are as mentioned below:</p>
<h5 id="operation-planning">Operation Planning</h5>
<p>Operation Planning service supports flight planning and accounts for various operational
impacts, including other known operations, aircraft performance, weather forecasts, ground
constraints, airspace constraints.</p>
<h5 id="communication">Communication</h5>
<p>Communication services provide infrastructure and quality of service assurance for radio
frequency (RF) Command, Control, Communication and Telemetry (C3T) capabilities and
UAS to UTM/ATM Systems to remote pilots.</p>
<h5 id="uas-health-monitoring">UAS Health Monitoring</h5>
<p>This service monitors the health and status of UAS system components (e.g., battery and
motors) in real-time, and uses the input data to formulate predictions about the components'
viability at desired time horizons.</p>
<h5 id="service-responsibility-matrix">Service Responsibility Matrix</h5>
<p>Appendix 3 - Service Responsibility Matrix defines the UTM services that can be provided by
the DigitalSky Platform and the UTMSPs. This identifies whether a particular UTM service is
available with the UTMSP interface or not. Availability of the UTM service at the UTMSP
level does not necessarily mean that the core responsibilities of providing the service will be
the responsibility of the UTMSP. The UTMSP may act as an interface and still rely on the
DigitalSky Platform to provide some of these services. Eg. A UAS Operator may seek flight
authorisation using the UTMSP interface but the primary responsibility of authorising the
flight still remains with the DigitalSky Platform.</p>
<h2 id="real-time-identification-and-tracking-of-uas">Real-time Identification and Tracking of UAS</h2>
<h3 id="introduction_1">Introduction</h3>
<p>The ability to identify and track a UAS flying in the Indian airspace will prove to be a very
important capability while enabling high density, complex UAS operations. Real-time
Identification and Tracking (RIT) of the UAS would enable sharing of the identity of the UAS
and its location to other airspace owners and people on the ground. This would empower
various stakeholders of the UTM Ecosystem by providing situational awareness about UAS.
Also, RIT functionality will enable law enforcement agencies to identify and locate UAS.
RIT is the functionality of a UAS to broadcast its identity and location directly in the airspace
around itself through various technologies like Bluetooth/Wi-Fi or through the internet by
connecting to a UTM Service Provider.</p>
<h3 id="rit-via-broadcast">RIT via Broadcast</h3>
<p>RIT via Broadcast is referred to as the functionality of the UAS when it transmits the
identification, location and other information over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, which can be received
and displayed by a commonly carried handheld device such as a mobile phone, using a
Mobile Application. This requires the UAS to advertise its identity and location over Wi-Fi
and Bluetooth and would require UAS Operators / Manufacturers to integrate additional
hardware to achieve the same. The operational range of such devices is expected to be less
than 100 metres due to the WiFi and Bluetooth standards, which is significantly low for
identifying a UAS.</p>
<h3 id="rit-via-network">RIT via Network</h3>
<p>RIT via Network is referred to as the functionality of the UAS when it transmits the
identification, location and other information over the internet to a UTM Service Provider
through a RIT Network Service. In this case, stakeholders such as law enforcement
agencies, airspace users and the general public connect with a UTM Service Provider to
access information about active UAS flights in their area of interest using a web-based or a
mobile application. Since this functionality is achieved by transmitting the identity, location
and other information over the internet, it overcomes the shortcomings of the RIT via
Broadcast. However, this functionality would not be available in areas with no network
access.</p>
<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>
<p>The section below proposes the implementation of RIT via Broadcast and RIT via Network
for different types of UAS in different operating scenarios. It is recommended that India
should implement RIT via Broadcast and/or RIT via Network, depending on the category of
UAS and area of operation, following a risk-based approach.</p>
<p>The RIT message should at least contain:</p>
<ol>
<li>UAS ID (serial number of UAS or DAN or UIN);</li>
<li>Latitude, longitude and barometric pressure altitude of Ground Control Station (GCS) and UA;</li>
<li>Timestamp (in UTC);</li>
<li>Intent information (magnetic heading and ground speed); and</li>
<li>Emergency status of the UAS such as lost-link.</li>
</ol>
<p>All legacy except Nano Category (in enclosed premises or flying below 50 feet in
uncontrolled airspace) UAS operating in India should also be retrofitted with appropriate RIT
features, as stated in this section, either integrated within the UAS or strapped-on to the
UAS in a manner which cannot be easily removed.
UAS not equipped with a RIT feature should be allowed to operate only in segregated
airspaces established for testing of UAS as defined by the competent authority from time to
time.</p>
<h4 id="rit-via-broadcast-implementation">RIT via Broadcast Implementation</h4>
<p>RIT via Broadcast over Wi-Fi and Bluetooth would consume additional power on-board and
may cause interference for UAS operating in de-licensed frequencies, thus reducing the
operational range of the UAS. As highlighted in section 6.2 the detection range for RIT via
Broadcast devices using standard Wi-Fi or Bluetooth modules may be severely limited. Also,
it is difficult to distinguish a UAS spoofing its identity over RIT via Broadcast without the
ability to verify its identity over the network.
Hence, it is recommended that studies or experiments be conducted or alternatives be
proposed for a more efficient and effective alternative for RIT via Broadcast over Bluetooth
or Wi-Fi before making RIT via Broadcast operational and mandatory.</p>
<h4 id="rit-via-network-implementation">RIT via Network Implementation</h4>
<p>All UAS required to participate actively in the UTM Service should implement RIT via
Network. UAS owned and operated by Law Enforcement Agencies (LEA) and First
Responders such as Fire Services, Authorised Hospitals and Disaster Management
Agencies shall also be required to implement the RIT via Network.
Defence UAS and UAS operated by agencies such as NTRO, ARC and Intelligence
agencies may, due to their confidentiality requirements, be exempted from equipping the
UAS owned and operated by them with RIT via Broadcast feature. However, such UAS shall
be equipped with RIT via Network. DigitalSky and UTMSPs may be suitably built to ensure
that identity, flight plan information and real-time position of such UAS are masked from
normal view and such details should be provided only to UTM and ATM operators on
need-basis. However, defence UAS under large category may be exempted from these
requirements provided such UAS is equipped with an alternate method of communicating
identity and position in real-time to ATC such as ADS-B or SSR transponder.</p>
<h2 id="utm-data-communication-security-and-privacy">UTM Data Communication, Security and Privacy</h2>
<h3 id="data-security-and-privacy">Data Security and Privacy</h3>
<p>UTM Systems enabling UAS operations are being deployed across different information
technology systems. These systems collect, generate, exchange and process registration,
pre-flight, in-flight and post-flight data of UAS operations. In addition to ensuring the safety of
operations, robust data privacy and data security mechanisms become a mandatory
requirement for such UTM systems. As these UTM systems are also available over the
internet, these systems are exposed to various data and network security threats. These
threats have the potential to impact UAS operations, other manned and unmanned aircraft
as well as involved and uninvolved people and property.
In order to meet the ecosystem requirements and protect IT systems against the various
threats, UTM systems would be required to follow the standards and regulations stipulated
by the DGCA specifically for the aviation IT systems and general guidelines by the
Government of India for data security and privacy. In general, data shall be exchanged or
stored in encrypted form. TLSv1.3 or similar latest standards shall be used for the exchange
of information between two systems. The UTM systems shall be compliant to ISO/IEC
27001:2013 or similar latest standards and other relevant standards from the ISO 27000
standards family.
Additionally, all the software and hardware systems would be required to be hosted in India.
If any system is required to be hosted on the cloud, then such cloud shall be a Ministry of
Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) empanelled cloud. It shall be ensured by the
system owner that all types of data including user-provided, collected, generated, analysed
and other similar data will reside in India and will not be accessed by any entity outside
India. Provisions of the proposed Indian Personal Data Protection Act, as and when
promulgated, shall be followed for maintaining the data privacy. Whenever any data is
shared by a government agency with any non-government agency then such data shall not
be shared further with any individual or entity without the permission from the government
agency. Each UTM system shall provide a secure interface to DigitalSky for online sharing
and auditing of the data. Competent Authority may also conduct the physical audit of the IT
system to ascertain the data security and privacy compliance of UTM systems. Depending
on the nature of the safety or security situation, historical or near-real-time information may
be needed and can be requested by competent authorities.
Operators would be required to archive certain data as per the DGCA rules and guidelines to
support post-flight requests by authorized entities on a need to know basis.
In future, the ICAO IATF and GRAIN standards may be evaluated for adoption.</p>
<h3 id="authentication-and-network-security">Authentication and Network Security</h3>
<p>As there are multiple entities providing different services in the UTM ecosystem, there is a
need for a framework for identification, authentication and authorization of the entities. In this
regard, a Registration Authority (RA) &amp; Certificate Authority (CA) service would be provided
by the government through the DigitalSky Platform to perform the vetting and proofing of the
identities. The authorization and authentication between entities would be enabled by the
DigitalSky Platform using identities issued by the RA &amp; CA. Authorized entities will utilize
network discovery services of the DigitalSky Platform to identify UTMSPs, SDSPs and other
stakeholders of the UTM Ecosystem and further request and receive data commensurate
with access credentials. The data exchange across the network links shall use the latest
secure communication channels like TLSv1.3 for exchange of the information between the
systems.
In future, the ICAO IATF and GRAIN standards may be evaluated for the adoption.</p>
<h2 id="safety-risk-management">Safety Risk Management</h2>
<h3 id="introduction_2">Introduction</h3>
<p>Civil Aviation Requirements (CAR) Section 1 - General, Series C, Part I, Issue II dated 27th
July 2017 provides the Regulation for Establishment of a Safety Management System (SMS)
for Aviation Organisations in India. The CAR stipulates that aviation organisations including
manufacturers and service providers shall develop, establish, maintain and adhere to a
safety management system. The guiding principles are in synchronisation with ICAO Annex
19 and DOC 9859.
This chapter describes the general procedures to be followed by organisations to conform
with the regulatory (DGCA), corporate and international (ICAO) standards and
recommended practices on safety management.</p>
<h3 id="icao-sms-framework">ICAO SMS Framework</h3>
<figure>
    <img src="icao-sms.svg" alt="ICAO SMS Framework">
    <figcaption>Figure 7.1: ICAO SMS Framework<figcaption>
</figure>

<p>ICAO Annex 19 contains the recommended SMS framework for aviation organisations. The
framework contains four components and 12 elements to be followed for establishing and
maintaining a robust safety management system in aviation organisations.
Every organisation involved in the provisions of UTM Service shall develop, establish,
maintain and adhere to a safety management system as per the provisions contained in the
DGCA Regulations.</p>
<h3 id="hazard-identification-and-risk-assessment">Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment</h3>
<p>A hazard is defined as a condition or an object with the potential to cause injuries to
personnel, damage to equipment or structures, loss of material, or reduction of ability to
perform a prescribed function.
The safety risk is the projected likelihood and severity of the most credible consequence or
outcome from an existing hazard.
Safety risk management encompasses the assessment and mitigation of safety risks. The
objective of safety risk management is to assess the risks associated with identified hazards
and develop and implement effective and appropriate mitigations.
Hazard Identification is a continuous, ongoing and daily activity. The hazard can be reported
from any source. The need for hazard identification is essential in the following conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Unexplained increase in safety-related incidents</li>
<li>During major operational changes</li>
<li>Significant organizational changes</li>
</ol>
<p>Hazard identification shall be based on a combination of reactive, proactive and predictive
methods of safety data collection. All identified hazards should be assigned a hazard
number and recorded in a hazard log along with its consequences.
Hazards may be identified through various data sources, which can be either internal or
external. Some examples of internal hazard identification data sources include voluntary and
mandatory reporting systems, safety surveys, safety auditing and follow-up reports on
accidents/incidents. Some examples of external hazard identification data sources include
state voluntary and mandatory reporting systems, state oversight audit and safety
information-sharing system.</p>
<h3 id="operational-risk-assessment-as-a-utm-service">Operational Risk Assessment as a UTM Service</h3>
<p>The categorisation of UAS accordingly to the maximum all-up weight and regulation of
operation of these categories through progressively more stringent requirements from lighter
to heavier UA is solely based on the energy calculation with the presumption that a lighter
UA has less energy than a heavier UA during operation and thus can cause comparatively
less harm to persons or property in the event of a collision.
Operational risk assessment should also consider additional factors by placing such
operations in the actual operating environment rather than conducting a general analysis
much before the actual day of operations.
It is recommended that in addition to the SMS processes UTM Service providers and other
aviation organisations are mandated to follow, UTM Service Providers may conduct an
operational risk assessment of every UA mission conducted through a UTM Service
provider. The operational risk assessment should be specific to the category of UA and the
planned mission, and should broadly follow the principles of safety management contained
in ICAO Annex 19, DOC 9859 and DGCA CAR.
Such a mission-specific operational risk assessment may be offered as a UTM service by
the UTMSPs.</p>
<h2 id="utm-atm-integration">UTM - ATM Integration</h2>
<h3 id="introduction_3">Introduction</h3>
<p>To achieve the phased objective of Segregation to Accommodation to Integration of
unmanned aircraft systems into the national airspace, associated ATM and UTM systems
should communicate with each other at the systems level. Operation of manned and
unmanned aircraft near UTM-ATM boundary and transition of manned aircraft into UTM
space or vice-versa should happen seamlessly with as less human intervention as possible.
This calls for mutually interoperable UTM and ATM systems. This chapter attempts to briefly
examine the requirements to set the stage for a robust UTM-ATM integration environment.</p>
<h3 id="icao-utm-framework">ICAO UTM Framework</h3>
<p>ICAO document titled “Unmanned Aircraft Systems Traffic Management (UTM) – A Common
Framework with Core Principles for Global Harmonization Edition 2” examines the issues
related to the operation of aircraft (manned as well as unmanned) near boundaries between
UTM and ATM airspace and also transition through these boundaries. ICAO suggests that:
States should consider several key operational aspects while establishing boundaries
between UTM-ATM areas of responsibilities. These include, inter alia:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identification of roles and responsibilities of UTM and ATM systems in terms of the level of service provided and service responsibility should the two overlap.</li>
<li>Development of operational procedures and coordination processes:<ol>
<li>for transitioning between UTM and ATM;</li>
<li>to allow traffic under UTM control to operate in an ATM environment and vice-versa; and</li>
<li>for operations in close proximity to adjacent airspaces</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Establishing separation standards between unmanned aircraft as well as between manned aircraft and unmanned aircraft.</li>
<li>Establishing the prioritization of operations (e.g. in-flight emergency or medical operations having priority over other aircraft).</li>
</ol>
<p>Under technology considerations, ICAO further suggests that:
States should consider several technological aspects while establishing boundaries between
UTM and ATM areas of responsibilities. These include, inter alia:</p>
<ol>
<li>technology to support collision avoidance;</li>
<li>automation to support traffic management and transitions between UTM to ATM;</li>
<li>information exchange capabilities between UTM and ATM systems for operations planning purposes and to enable situational awareness; and</li>
<li>capabilities to meet performance requirements needed to achieve interoperability (e.g. CNS requirements).</li>
</ol>
<p>The ICAO framework document also provides guidance on essential information exchange
between UTM and ATM systems. The various elements of UTM-ATM information exchange
are also provided.
This policy recognises the need for a robust UTM-ATM interoperability and integration policy
which is globally acceptable and consistent with the seamless ATM concept. Accordingly,
the requirement of information exchange between UTM and ATM systems has already been
considered in the UTM architecture contained in Chapter 5.
This policy supports the ICAO UTM framework and intends to align itself with the ICAO
policy on UTM-ATM interoperability and integration.</p>
<h2 id="utm-operational-scenarios">UTM OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS</h2>
<h3 id="scenario-1-flying-for-testing-or-recreational-purposes-or-in-enclosed-premises">Scenario 1: Flying for Testing or Recreational Purposes or in Enclosed Premises</h3>
<p>UAS and its associated components (payload, radio, etc) undergo various experimentations
and may require the conduct of experimental operations. UAS manufacturers may be
engaged in regular research and development activities and would need frequent flying of
experimental UAS. Risks associated with flying such UAS are high as in some of the cases
such operations would be conducted on UAS which are not certified as Airworthy.
Also, UAS may be flown for recreational or educational purposes. This would include UAS
being flown by Aeromodellers for recreational purposes or by educational institutions under
various educational training programs. Educational training programs may also be
conducted in enclosed premises. Usually, the risk during such operations would be low to
moderate as the range of operations is limited to visual line of sight in most of such cases.
As the purpose of such operations is specific and such operations can be conducted in
designated areas, the UTM ecosystem may propose a framework for identification of
designated sites as testing sites or recreational sites where UAS can be flown for testing or
recreational purposes. In such cases, airworthiness certification may not be mandatory for all
classes of UAS and the participation of such UAS, operating in the designated sites, in the
UTM Ecosystem for this operational scenario may be voluntary. However, it may require
compliance with other standard operating procedures as defined by the regulator from time
to time.</p>
<h3 id="scenario-2-flying-within-visual-line-of-sight-vlos-in-uncontrolled-airspace">Scenario 2: Flying within Visual Line of Sight (VLOS) in Uncontrolled Airspace</h3>
<p>A vast variety of commercial applications like surveying, mapping, agriculture spraying,
cinematography would be carried out in uncontrolled airspace. UAS operations for such use
cases are limited to visual line of sight with the remote pilot always in command. Further,
flying in uncontrolled airspace significantly reduces the risk of a potential conflict with
manned aircraft. However, the risk posed to ground assets is not mitigated.
Such operational scenarios may mandate general airworthiness certification and
requirement of standard equipment on board the UAS for participation in the UTM
ecosystem.</p>
<h3 id="scenario-3-flying-beyond-visual-line-of-sight-bvlos-in-uncontrolled-airspace">Scenario 3: Flying Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) in Uncontrolled Airspace</h3>
<p>Capabilities of Scenario 2 will be expanded to accommodate large scale applications like
large scale surveying and mapping, long-range surveillance, linear asset inspection, etc. The
volume of such UAS operations would also be high. In this scenario, the remote pilot would
be in command of the UAS or would be able to at least take control of the UAS whenever</p>
<p>required. Flying in uncontrolled airspace would again reduce the risk of a potential conflict
with manned aircraft. However, the risk to ground assets and uninvolved persons would still
be high as the remote pilot in command would only be able to observe the position of the
UAS via a combination of various sensors and a remote screen.
Such operational scenarios may mandate a higher level of airworthiness certification in
combination with additional onboard equipment pertinent for safe BVLOS operations and for
participation in the UTM ecosystem.</p>
<h3 id="scenario-4-flying-within-visual-line-of-sight-vlos-in-controlled-airspace">Scenario 4: Flying within Visual Line of Sight (VLOS) in Controlled Airspace</h3>
<p>Airspaces over major metro cities fall in the controlled airspace and here are huge
requirements of conducting UAS Operations for multiple use cases. Airworthiness
requirements for this scenario may be similar to Scenario 1 with additional CNS equipment
requirements for ATM systems.</p>
<h3 id="scenario-5-flying-beyond-visual-line-of-sight-bvlos-in-controlled-airspace">Scenario 5: Flying Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) in Controlled Airspace</h3>
<p>Scenario 4 may be extended for use cases like pipeline monitoring, power line inspection,
etc for BVLOS operations in controlled airspace. Airworthiness requirements for this
scenario may be similar to Scenario 2 with additional CNS equipment requirements for ATM
systems.</p>
<h3 id="scenario-6-flying-in-no-fly-zones">Scenario 6: Flying in No-Fly Zones</h3>
<p>Flying over strategic installations like government administration buildings, defence
installations, police and paramilitary installations, reserve forests, industrial assets of
national significance may pose additional risk. In such operational scenarios, additional
clearances from a safety, security and environmental perspective may be prescribed by the
regulator.</p>
<h3 id="scenario-7-autonomous-operations">Scenario 7: Autonomous Operations</h3>
<p>Autonomous operations help manage complex use cases like patrolling around sensitive
areas, long-range deliveries, regular inspections of assets. Such use cases may require
special airworthiness certification with a focus on higher reliability of the UAS, sophisticated
Detect and Avoid systems and redundancy of flight-critical components. Filing of flight path
and flight intent prior to the operation may be mandated by the regulator. Further, the
regulator may mandate Bi-Modal control capabilities on the UAS for taking over control and
command of the Autonomous UAS in case of emergencies.</p>
<h3 id="scenario-8-night-operations">Scenario 8: Night Operations</h3>
<p>The ability to operate at night is a crucial requirement for applications such as security and
surveillance, emergency response. UAS with flight critical subsystems dependent on daylight
may not be permitted for night operations. If the remote pilot uses visual reference or camera
feed, in daylight, for control or navigation of the UAS, then such UAS may also not be
permitted for night operations. Additional security and environment-related operating
conditions may be mandated by the regulator.</p>
<h3 id="scenario-9-unmanned-aerial-mobility">Scenario 9: Unmanned Aerial Mobility</h3>
<p>Unmanned Aerial Mobility may follow conventional airworthiness standards of manned
aircraft with additional equipment and operational requirements, some of which are as
suggested below:</p>
<ol>
<li>pre-flight safety video</li>
<li>real-time tracking</li>
<li>two-way communication capabilities with the passenger(s) for contingencies</li>
<li>alarm system to alert passengers and uninvolved persons in case of contingencies</li>
<li>flight path information for the passenger</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="scenario-10-swarming">Scenario 10: Swarming</h3>
<p>UAS swarms may help increase the efficiency of conventional UAS operations like search
and rescue operations. However, depending on the nature of swarm operations they may
pose different complexities. Different ways of blocking airspace, identification of each UAS
and the swarm as a whole, bimodal communication with each UAS and the swarm as a
whole, submission of flight logs, etc maybe some of these. Due to the complexity of this
operational scenario, it may be further defined in subsequent versions of this document.</p>
<h3 id="scenario-11-payload-management">Scenario 11: Payload Management</h3>
<p>Certain UAS operations like logistics UAS, spraying UAS or fuel-powered UAS may involve
discharging of payloads in flight or consumption of fuel during operations. The maximum
takeoff weight of the UAS will vary in such operational conditions. In addition, many UAS are
designed to carry a variety of payloads with different weights. This may present the need to
certify airworthiness for a range of maximum takeoff weights and different payload
configurations. Further, the UAS, in any case, may not exceed its maximum takeoff weight
and the characteristics of the payloads being carried by the UAS should be pre-approved.
Additional considerations should be made for clearing airspace when a payload is dropped
or discharged from a UAS.</p>
<h2 id="development-of-utm-business-rules">Development of UTM Business Rules</h2>
<h3 id="introduction_4">Introduction</h3>
<p>Provision of UTM service shall be based on common business rules applicable to UTM
Service Providers. Such business rules are required to ensure safety and security of UA
operations conducted through UTMSPs and also to ensure safety and security of uninvolved
persons and property, thereby reducing the risk of collateral damage to an acceptable level.
This chapter identifies the requirement of defining the business rules in a few minimum
areas, which should be followed by UTMSPs while providing UTM Service. However, the
technical business rules required to ensure compliance with the technical standards set by
the regulator are not considered in this chapter.</p>
<h3 id="flight-rules-for-unmanned-aircraft-systems">Flight Rules for Unmanned Aircraft Systems</h3>
<p>The existing Flight Rules of the Air, i.e. Visual Flight Rules (VFR) and Instrument Flight
Rules (IFR) were coined for manned aircraft, with the presumption that a pilot is controlling
the moving aircraft. However, in the case of unmanned aircraft, the pilot is outside the
aircraft and in case of autonomous flights, would not even be controlling the flight. Thus, the
existing flight rules may not be suitable for unmanned aircraft operations.
It is recommended that the flight rules for unmanned aircraft may be different (say UFR),
wherein the rules of the air become more suitable for unmanned aircraft (See and Avoid is
replaced by Sense and Avoid or Detect and Avoid, etc.).</p>
<h3 id="airspace-classification-of-utm-airspace">Airspace Classification of UTM Airspace</h3>
<p>The existing classification of airspace as Controlled and Uncontrolled airspace can lead to
jurisdictional and functional confusion among ATM and UTM Service Providers. Provision of
UTM Service in ATM airspace (even Class G airspace which is uncontrolled is an ATM
airspace now) by UTMSPs could be construed as an issue of overlapping responsibilities.
The conditions laid out for compliance by aircraft operators and by ATM / UTM Service
Providers in existing classes of airspace (Classes A to G) may not be suitable for UAS
operations.
It is recommended that airspaces identified for provision of UTM service may have a
different classification (say U-Airspace), where all participating manned and unmanned
aircraft are required to abide by the requirements of the airspace. Operation of UA beyond
the
U-airspace would demand complete compliance with the requirements of the
corresponding (existing) class of airspace the UA is operating in.</p>
<p>It would also be worth considering different sub-categories under U airspace to account for
the widely varying operational and performance requirements. Thus, under U airspace,
sub-categorisation such as U1, U2, U3 etc. may prevail. A typical operational and
performance requirement matrix (totally presumptive) is placed as Table 10.1.</p>
<p>Table 11.1: Indicative Operational and Performance Requirements for U-Airspace</p>

</table>
<p>To allow seamless and unhindered operation of UA in some portions of ATM airspaces
(Classes A to G) where such operations are not a matter of concern for ATM service
providers, such portions can be hived off from ATM classification and designated as
temporary U airspace.</p>
<h3 id="separation-standards-for-unmanned-aircrafts">Separation Standards for Unmanned Aircrafts</h3>
<p>The existing separation standards designed to ensure the safety of aircraft operations by
keeping them horizontally and vertically apart by a fixed margin may not be suitable for
unmanned aircraft owing to the extremely small size of a majority of UAs and the wide
variation in their performance characteristics including cruising speeds.
It is recommended that minimum horizontal and vertical separation standards between two
unmanned aircraft and between a manned and unmanned aircraft may be designed. Such
standards will help UTM Services providers (and ATMSPs) in providing the strategic and
dynamic deconfliction service and when mandated, separation service, to participating
unmanned and manned aircraft.</p>
<p>The existing separation standards between manned aircraft does not consider the type or
weight category of aircraft involved, except in case of wake turbulence separation. However,
this cannot be the case for unmanned aircraft. Due to widely varying weight and
performance characteristics, it is recommended to have a series of separation standards
based on weight and speed. Implementation of such separation standards would be taken
care of by UTM systems and not controllers as in the case of ATM airspace, and hence
having multiple separation standards would not possibly create any significant human factor
issues.</p>
<h4 id="concept-of-flight-bubble">Concept of Flight Bubble</h4>
<p>One such separation standard could be called the Flight Bubble. Current tracking standards
enable sharing of real-time position information of the UAS, however, there may also be an
additional need for establishing a Flight Bubble for providing safe separation services
between aircraft and communicating about the same to other aircraft flying nearby.
The Flight Bubble can be explained using the infographic below:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="flight-bubble.svg" alt="Concept of Flight Bubble">
    <figcaption>Figure 10.1: Concept of Flight Bubble<figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The UAS shall only be able to sense each other as flight bubbles, ensuring that all flights
happen with the adequate safety margins, and variances due to equipment and/or type of
operation are well accounted for using algorithms.
In the case of the Emergency Landing or a Failure, the data shall be exchanged between the
UAS (for performance level variables &amp; failure modes) and the UTMSP. The UTMSP shall
share data about the safe landing spots available according to the flight plan. The UAS flight
path may ensure that the Flight Bubble always extends to the terrain for landing in a safe
spot during any emergency flight termination.</p>
<p>In case such safe spots are not available, and the Flight Bubble does not extend to the
ground, additional mitigation measures may be considered. The concept of a flight bubble is
preliminary and may undergo revisions before adoption. Further, additional separation
standards may be formulated for different operational scenarios and as the density of the UA
in the airspace increases.</p>
<h3 id="terrain-obstacle-clearance-standards-for-unmanned-aircrafts">Terrain &amp; Obstacle Clearance Standards for Unmanned Aircrafts</h3>
<p>Clearance from terrain and obstacles can be achieved in two ways; through Vehicle-based
systems or as a UTM Service. When vehicle-based systems are used, the responsibility of
avoiding collision with terrain and obstacles remain with the pilot or operator. However, when
this service is provided by the UTMSP, the responsibility for providing collision avoidance
service lies with the UTMSP.
It is recommended that terrain and obstacle clearance standards for unmanned aircraft may
be designed and published for compliance by UAS manufacturers (for vehicle-based
systems) and UTM Service Providers. Considering the wide variation in the performance
characteristics of unmanned aircraft systems, it is recommended to mandate a risk-based
standard with the performance expectation of reducing the risk of collateral damage to an
acceptable level. This means that the clearance from terrain and obstacles need not be
stipulated as a static value (like 50 m from any person or 100 ft. from all buildings) but
should be coined as an algorithm considering various aspects such as performance
characteristics of the UA, whether remotely piloted or autonomous, prevailing weather etc.,
akin to the collision avoidance algorithm used in autonomous cars.</p>
<h3 id="minimum-distance-to-be-flown-for-safety-of-uninvolved-persons">Minimum Distance to be Flown for Safety of Uninvolved Persons</h3>
<p>Algorithm-based standards may be defined for ensuring the safety of uninvolved persons
similar to the recommendations in section 10.4 above.</p>
<h3 id="minimum-distance-to-be-flown-for-noise-abatement">Minimum Distance to be Flown for Noise Abatement</h3>
<p>Algorithm-based standards may be defined for ensuring that unmanned aircraft are operated
at such distances required for ensuring compliance with environmental regulations, similar to
the recommendations in section 10.4 above.</p>
<h3 id="limiting-weather-conditions-for-uas-operations">Limiting Weather Conditions for UAS Operations</h3>
<p>UTM systems should take into account the weather restrictions imposed by the Regulator on
UAS operations, with mechanisms to dynamically control the operation of participating UAs
based on the real-time weather information provided by SDSPs.</p>
<h2 id="utm-deployment-plan">UTM DEPLOYMENT PLAN</h2>
<p>The density of UAS operations and types of UAS Operations may vary in different
geographical locations. Some locations may have a high density of operations whereas
other remote locations may not have any operations at all. Also, some UAS operations may
be relatively complex in nature due to the technology advancement and special
requirements of the business case. Thus, different airspaces may have different levels of
UAS traffic management requirements and the deployment plan of UTM services in India
would play a key role in effectively managing UAS operations.
Three primary strategies are generally considered while planning deployment of UTM
systems in any country: ‘Single UTM Per Region Strategy’, ‘Multiple UTMs Per Region
Strategy’ and ‘Hybrid Strategy’.</p>
<h3 id="single-utm-per-region-strategy">Single UTM Per Region Strategy</h3>
<p>This strategy allocates a particular airspace region (city/state/FIR) to a single UTM service
provider. This strategy provides a relatively simple, easy to adopt the deployment model and
assigns a single point of authority for traffic management per airspace region. However, the
same UTM may also become a single point of failure and in case of any issues with the UTM
Service, the entire airspace region would become non-serviceable. Also, since this strategy
would be monopolistic in nature, it does not keep the UTM Service Provider motivated
enough to provide high levels of services to the users.</p>
<h3 id="multiple-utms-per-region-strategy">Multiple UTMs Per Region Strategy</h3>
<p>This strategy allocates single airspace (usually large) to multiple UTM Service Providers and
adds the complexity of multiple UTMs to coordinate with each other using Inter-UTM
communication. It ensures that a single UTM system does not become a single point of
failure and establishes a healthy competition between multiple UTM Service Providers,
hence ensuring higher service levels and lower fees for UTM Services. However, this model
does not account for service providers wanting to operate in small segregated airspace.</p>
<h3 id="hybrid-strategy">Hybrid Strategy</h3>
<p>The Hybrid deployment strategy allows multiple UTM systems to manage the same airspace
to avoid a single point of failure and but also allows for smaller UTM systems running special
UA operations (for eg. asset inspection, security surveillance or delivery of health packages
in rural areas) to either manage the segregated airspace assigned to them or integrate with
larger UTM systems running in the same airspace. This strategy allows complete flexibility
for anyone to manage airspaces on their own provided they are compliant with the rules laid
down by the regulator. This strategy extracts the best of both strategies proposed above,
creates a best-case scenario for deploying UTMs and is the ​chosen UTM deployment
strategy for India​.</p>
<h2 id="utm-service-charges">UTM SERVICE CHARGES</h2>
<p>UTM Service Providers host technical infrastructure and partner with supplementary data
service providers to provide UTM services to manufacturers, traders, importers, owners,
operators, remote pilots and other stakeholders. This may involve significant cost overheads
to develop and maintain critical systems as per defined standards. UTMSPs may choose to
charge the user for service provided by them and may choose different pricing models for
the same.</p>
<h3 id="pricing-models">Pricing Models</h3>
<p>The pricing models may depend on multiple factors like category and quantity of UAS, the
number of remote pilots, the number of flights, etc. UTMSP may also choose to have
dynamic pricing models for special parameters like the density of UAS operations in
real-time, number of UTM-ATM crossovers, the risk level of operations, use of
supplementary data, use of other additional non-mandatory features, etc. Some of the
pricing models envisioned for the UTM Ecosystem are described below:</p>
<h4 id="subscription-model">Subscription Model</h4>
<p>UTMSPs may choose to bill users on a fixed weekly, monthly, quarterly or yearly fee. The
UTMSP may choose to price the user based on the number of UAS, number of flights,
number of remote pilots per operator or add their own custom pricing variables to define the
subscription cost. In case, operators and remote pilots choose to subscribe through such a
pricing model to UTMSPs not operating Pan-India, they may face difficulties in receiving
UTM Services in regions where the UTMSP does not operate. In such areas, the UTMSP
may integrate with other UTMSPs to provide UTM Services or may ask the operator or
remote pilot to use another UTMSP on their own.</p>
<h4 id="pay-per-use-model">Pay Per Use Model</h4>
<p>UTMSPs may choose to bill users on a totally dynamic basis instead of a fixed periodic fee.
In this case, the UTMSP may choose to charge every user on a pay per flight basis. The
UTMSP may choose to standardise rates for some parameters like price per
kilometre/square kilometre or price per minute and may have dynamic rates for special
parameters as mentioned in the first part of this chapter. In this pricing scenario, the operator
and remote pilot would be able to choose a UTMSP during the flight planning stage. Such a
pricing model may not bind the operator or remote pilot with a fixed UTMSP. The operator or
remote pilot may keep switching between UTMSPs on a need or performance basis.</p>
<h4 id="subscription-pay-per-use-model">Subscription + Pay Per Use Model</h4>
<p>UTMSPs may also choose to create a mixed pricing model by combining both the pricing
models mentioned above. In this case, the UTMSP may have tiers of subscription models
based on standard parameters like category and quantity of UAS, number or remote pilots,
the number of flights, etc. and may additionally have value-added packages or rates for
special parameters like high-risk operations, surge pricing in high-density flight scenarios,
fees per UTM-ATM crossover, etc. Such a model may provide the right balance between
subscribing for a fixed fee for most use cases and will provide pricing options to users for
rare scenarios or less frequent scenarios.
The pricing models mentioned above are indicative. The UTMSP may choose to implement
their own pricing models in conjunction with the minimum fees and procedures laid down by
the competent authorities from time to time.</p>
<h3 id="service-charges-to-utmsps">Service Charges to UTMSPs</h3>
<p>The Airports Authority of India (AAI) may charge the UTMSP, a fee, as Airspace Usage
Charges. This fee would be in addition to the registration and other fees charged by the
DGCA and other competent authorities during the setting up of the UTMSP. These charges,
mainly Airspace Usage Charges would be charged on a per-flight basis, the pricing of which
may be fixed by the AAI and/or other competent authorities based on standards and
parameters as mentioned above. The overall definition of these fees may be done in such a
manner that the UTMSP may share a minimal percentage of the fee charged to the user with
the AAI.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>This document aims to create a roadmap for enabling high density, complex operational
scenarios of UAS operations in the low-level airspace in India. This document has
recognised various stakeholders and their primary responsibilities for enabling such UAS
Operations. This document also defines the overall architecture of the UTM Ecosystem and
highlights how different stakeholders will be communicating with each other to enable such
UAS operations.
Further, this discussion draft would be revised after receiving public comments and the
National UTM Policy would be published thereafter.</p>
