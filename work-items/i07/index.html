<ul>
<li>Geospatial Mapping
    Drones can be a decisive force multiplier for resource/ infrastructure planning for India’s growing needs through geospatial surveys. Besides providing enhanced accuracy and safety, drone surveys:<ul>
<li>Reduce the cost and time for a survey </li>
<li>Provide increased data accuracy </li>
<li>Provide easier access to hard reach areas </li>
<li>Enable Automatic pre-programmed 2D and 3D mapping </li>
<li>Enable specific applications such as mining through special sensors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Precision Agriculture
    These practices allow fine-scale monitoring and mapping of yield and crops providing more intense and efficient cultivation methods by adjusting fertilizer or pesticide prescriptions. In turn, significant cost and environmental savings can be made making Indian agriculture globally competitive besides enhancing the quality of crops for domestic consumption.</li>
<li>Efficient Last Mile Logistics
    Drones can arguably be considered the best solution for India’s last mile logistics issues given the traffic congestion in our urban areas and limited infrastructure in the hinterland. Cost effective and timely delivery of critical items such as medical supplies, besides the promise of urban air mobility, are veritable boons for India. </li>
<li>Security Applications and Innovations
    India has lagged in defence research and development which has been the driver for many new age technologies through agencies such as DARPA. We are slow off the mark but our technological base is well positioned to provide an ideal launchpad for cutting edge innovations in this field which will help not only address our unique security challenges but also establish market leadership for global sales. </li>
</ul>

</ol>
<h3 id="food-for-thought">Food for Thought</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Requirement of Type Certificate</strong>: <em>Drone Rules 21</em> mandate airworthiness certification for drones whereas, appropriate standards have not been notified. </li>
<li><strong>Lack of Airspace Integration Vision</strong>: <em>Drone Rules 2021</em> lack provisions for eventual integration of drone operations alongside manned aircraft.</li>
<li><strong>Business confidentiality must be preserved</strong>: The prescribed rules for access to data are not in consonance with the Supreme Court Right to Privacy Judgement</li>
<li><strong>Lack of transparent Import Policy</strong>: Places severe restrictions on the import of critical components thus disincentivizing indigenous development of drones in India </li>
<li><strong>Insurance &amp; Training must be market-driven</strong>: Market forces must drive the setting up of specialised training schools &amp; insurance products &amp; once mature they may be mandated &amp; accredited. This will result in the creation of higher quality services &amp; a safer ecosystem.</li>
<li><strong>Fostering innovation and becoming Atmanirbhar</strong>: <ul>
<li><strong>Encouraging R&amp;D:</strong> by earmarking airspace for testing for future drones</li>
<li><strong>Encouraging the domestic drone manufacturing industry</strong>: through a system of incentives and disincentivizing imports should be inherent in the Drone Rules. </li>
<li><strong>Recognition of Hobby flying</strong>: Hobbyists are a vital part of the innovation ecosystem; however, they are not adequately recognised and legitimized</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Encouraging A Just Culture:</strong> Effective root cause analysis would encourage a safety-oriented approach to drone operations. Penal actions should be the last resort and dispute resolution should be the focus.</li>
<li><strong>Enabling Increased Safety &amp; Security</strong>: Clarity on NPNT operationalisation would enhance safety and security manifold.</li>
<li><strong>No Clear Institutional Architecture:</strong> Like GSTN, NPCI, NHA, ISRO, etc a special purpose vehicle must be created to anchor the long-term success of drone operations based on an established concept of operations</li>
<li><strong>Lack of a Concept of Operations</strong>: Although drone categories have been defined, they have not been used adequately for incremental permissions. Failure to adopt an incremental approach can arguably be considered as one of the root causes of the drone policy failures till date in India as regulations are being framed for too many varied considerations without adequate experience in any. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-is-a-concept-of-operations">What is a ‘Concept of Operations’?</h3>
<ul>
<li>A Concept of Operations (ConOps) is a user-oriented document that describes characteristics for a proposed system from an integrated point of view to stakeholders</li>
<li>It is produced early in the requirements definition phase to describe what a system will do (<em>not how it will do it</em>) and the design rationale.</li>
<li>The purpose of a ConOps is to describe the operational needs, desires, visions, and expectations of the user without being overly technical or formal. </li>
<li>It defines any critical objectives and performance requirements.</li>
<li>ConOps is useful for obtaining consensus among the users and all other stakeholders on the operational concept of a proposed system. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-a-conops-for-drones-in-india-now">Why a ConOps for Drones in India Now</h3>
<ul>
<li>New field – limited information</li>
<li>Can have a huge public impact</li>
<li>Sub-optimal progression of UAS Policy </li>
<li>No effective operations despite huge market</li>
<li>Globally, most of the significant policy progress has come based on defined ConOps e.g. FAA, EASA and ICAO</li>
<li>Help build consensus for policy faster </li>
<li>Enable simultaneous addressing of multifarious bottlenecks</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-flow-that-works">A flow that works!</h3>
<p><img alt="Flow" src="../assets/i07-flow-that-works.png" /></p>
<h3 id="drones-vs-uas-vs-rpas-vs-model">Drones vs UAS vs RPAS vs Model</h3>
<ul>
<li>Drones – common/ layman terminology for Unmanned Aircraft (UA). </li>
<li>There are three subsets of Unmanned Aircraft : </li>
<li>Unmanned Aircraft</li>
<li>Remotely Piloted Aircraft, and </li>
<li>Model Aircraft</li>
<li>Unmanned aircraft system (UAS) – an unmanned aircraft and its associated elements, operated with no pilot on board. Kept away from manned aircraft by airspace restrictions</li>
<li>Remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) - unmanned aircraft, actively piloted from a remote pilot station. Can use same airspace but subjected to same safety standards as manned aircraft</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="icao-uas-vs-rpas">ICAO : UAS vs RPAS</h3>
<p>ICAO is making a clear distinction between those UA that can be accommodated in airspace by keeping them away from other aircraft and those that can be integrated in airspace alongside manned aircraft (i.e. RPA)</p>
<p>Unmanned aircraft means an aircraft operated without the possibility of direct human intervention from within or on the aircraft. </p>
<h3 id="model-aircraft">Model Aircraft</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Model Aircraft - UA without payload used for educational/ recreational purposes only. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generally model aircraft must meet the following criteria:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be capable of sustained flight in the atmosphere</p>
</li>
<li>Be flown within visual line-of-sight of the person operating it</li>
<li>Be flown for hobby or recreational purposes</li>
<li>
<p>Not be flown over people or near aerodromes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Payload - All equipment on board a UAV that are not needed for the flight or its control. It aims exclusively to fulfill a specific mission.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="uas-in-india">UAS in India</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>UAS in India are currently categorized in accordance with MTOW (including payload) as indicated below: </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nano : Less than or equal to 250 grams. </p>
</li>
<li>Micro : More than 250 grams &amp; less than/ equal to 2 kg. </li>
<li>Small : Greater than 2 kg &amp; less than or equal to 25 kg. </li>
<li>Medium : More than 25 kg &amp; less than/ equal to 150 kg. </li>
<li>Large : Greater than 150 upto 500 kg. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>However no difference in regulations for Small - Large categories; no mention of RPAS and no provisions for Models or Operational categories</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Use of the terms needs serious review in order to align with the international community and better compliance</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="uas-applications">UAS Applications</h3>
<ul>
<li>Aerial Photography and Videography</li>
<li>Survey and Mapping</li>
<li>Inspections of critical infrastructure</li>
<li>Surveillance</li>
<li>Agricultural Services</li>
<li>Cargo Delivery</li>
<li>Search and Rescue</li>
<li>Public Security </li>
<li>Disaster Relief and Disease Control</li>
<li>Science and Research</li>
<li>Entertainment</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Majority of these applications can be achieved using small Rotary Wing UASs though some of them may benefit from fixed wing or larger UASs</em></p>

<li>Safety</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Infrastructure Constraints</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="efficiency">Efficiency</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Regulations need to be UAS-centric and not lean too heavily on traditional manned aviation. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simple regulations with minimal compliance costs needed in order to </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide a fillip to the industry</p>
</li>
<li>attract investments </li>
<li>encourage legitimate use </li>
<li>
<p>Provide time for evolution of standards and ensuing compliance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Efficient regulations enable </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>development of market capacity and further innovations</p>
</li>
<li>reduced gestation period for SMEs</li>
<li>wider spectrum of users</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="safety">Safety</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>UAS should be progressively integrated into the existing aviation system in a safe and risk-proportionate manner </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UAS Regulations must </p>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>minimize risk to safety of people and assets</li>
<li>meet India’s ICAO obligations towards safety</li>
<li>meet the safety and operational standards applicable to manned aircraft when operating in non-segregated airspace</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternately UAS operations must be restricted to </p>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>specific conditions e.g. visual line-of-sight (VLOS); or</li>
<li>segregated airspace outside the operational ambit of manned aircraft; or </li>
<li>specific areas e.g. away from heavily populated areas</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rules must express objectives that are complemented by industry standards</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="security">Security</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>India has long history of sub-conventional warfare in the form of terrorism</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UAS are ideal tool for terrorists</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Potential saturation of our security establishment in differentiating between the ‘good’ and the ‘bad’ actors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use of UAS can initially be limited to categories that are</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>easily identified </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>incapable of significant harm</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protection of public interests such as personal privacy</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="infrastructure-issues">Infrastructure Issues</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Development of UTM concepts and infrastructure is crucial for large scale UAS use</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UAS Traffic Management based on:</p>

<p>Each UAS transmitting a unique remote ID with a geo tracking feature </p>
</li>
<li>Unmanned Traffic Management Systems for Very Low Level segregated airspace accommodating exclusive UAS traffic </li>
<li>
<p>UAS in non-segregated controlled airspace need to meet manned aircraft standards</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UAS integration in non-segregated airspace will pose challenges</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Development of the UAS market and related technologies needs to be carefully monitored and the planning adapted. </p>
